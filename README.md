Data Analysis with Python Basics
Objective:
To develop a comprehensive understanding of how to use variables, data types, operators, and control structures in Python by simulating basic data analysis operations relevant to a credit card company.


Scenario:
You will create a Python script that performs data analysis tasks on simulated customer transaction data for Bits, a London-based credit card company. This assignment aims to help you practice fundamental concepts of Python programming.


Components of the Assignment:
Simulate Data:

Task: Define variables to represent customer information, including:

Customer Name (string)

Customer Age (integer)

Customer Credit Score (float)

Number of Transactions (integer)

Total Spending (float)

Define conditions for classifying the credit score as "Excellent," "Good," or "Needs Improvement."

Average spending per transaction

Credit score classification

Total spending calculated using the loop

Deliverable: Create a section in your Python script that initializes these variables with sample values.

Task: Calculate the average spending per transaction for the customer. This involves using the variables you defined earlier and applying appropriate arithmetic operators to perform the calculation.

Deliverable: Document the calculation process in your script, explaining each step clearly.

Task: Implement an if-else statement to classify the customer based on their credit score:

Deliverable: Write this logic in your script, ensuring that it prints the customer's credit classification based on the defined conditions.

Task: Use a loop to simulate processing multiple transactions. Assume each transaction has a fixed amount (for example, $100), and iterate over the number of transactions to calculate total spending.

Deliverable: Incorporate this loop in your script, and document the calculations performed during each iteration.

Task: Ensure your script prints all key results, including:

Deliverable: Present all results clearly, highlighting how each value was derived.

Use of Operators:

Conditional Logic:

Looping Through Data:

Final Output:
